# Project-Get-Away-Heist
Heist Driving Game

Code used to prototype a kart racer/heist game

Game concept was that the player controls like a cart racer, following a money truck collecting the money from it. 
The player then trys to escape from the police after collecting the money.

Dropped it for now, feel free to take any code you want. I didn't leave it in that good of shape so I apologize.
